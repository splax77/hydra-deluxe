"""The meaning layer: turn raw addresses into named facts about the engine.

Everything above this module talks about "the total window" or "precision
mode", never about byte offsets or RVAs. This module is the only place in the
probe that knows an engine field lives at object_ptr + 0x20. It gets its
addresses from constants.py and its plumbing (memory reads, breakpoints) from a
ProcessHandle and a Debugger passed in.

Why the dependency injection: this module never imports debugger.py, nor
process.py's Process class or its Win32 backend. It only depends on the
ProcessHandle and Debugger Protocols in interfaces.py -- the shapes, not the
concrete classes. That is what lets the unit tests drive it with fake objects
and no running game. The one thing it takes from process.py is the pure byte
decoders, so a snapshot block decodes exactly as a single-field read does.
