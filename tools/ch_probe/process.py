"""The process/address layer for the Clone Hero drum hit-window probe.

Plain version: this is the piece that reaches into the running game's memory.
It opens the Clone Hero process, finds where GameAssembly.dll got loaded, and
turns the fixed addresses in constants.py into live addresses it can read.

Two ideas keep this file honest:

  * An RVA is "how far into the DLL", not a real address. The DLL loads at a
    different spot every run (Windows randomizes it). So a live address is
    always module_base + rva, and module_base is discovered when we attach.
  * Before trusting any read, we byte-check two known constants against the
    values Ghidra saw. If Clone Hero updated and shifted everything, those two
    reads come back wrong and we refuse to run instead of reporting garbage.
    That check is milestone 1 in the spec: if 85.0 and 37.5 come out, the whole
    address pipeline is proven.

The raw Windows calls (OpenProcess, ReadProcessMemory, the process/module
snapshots) live behind small seams so the decode and decision logic can be
tested with fabricated bytes, no game required. The only part that genuinely
needs a live Clone Hero is open_process itself.
