"""The Win32 debug loop for the Clone Hero hit-window probe.

Plain version: this is the measuring instrument. It attaches to the running
game as a debugger, plants breakpoints at chosen code addresses, and hands you
the CPU registers and memory each time one is hit. That is how the layers above
read the numbers the engine computes.

A software breakpoint here is one byte: we overwrite the first byte of an
instruction with 0xCC (the x86 "int3" trap), remember the byte we replaced, and
the CPU traps into us when it reaches that spot. To let the program keep
running we put the real byte back, step over that one instruction, then write
0xCC again so the breakpoint fires next time too. That put-back / step /
re-arm dance is the heart of this file.

The code splits into two halves on purpose:

  * Pure logic with no Windows calls -- the breakpoint bookkeeping (which byte
    to save, when it is armed), decoding the XMM0 register into a double, and
    the "rip minus one" fix-up. This half is unit-tested with a fake memory
    dict; no game needs to run.
  * The live Win32 pump -- ctypes calls to DebugActiveProcess,
    WaitForDebugEvent, GetThreadContext and friends. This half only works
    against a real debuggee, so it is quarantined behind a clear seam and the
    tests do not touch it. Every such spot is marked "LIVE-ONLY".

Memory goes through process.py: its pure decoders turn bytes into numbers,
and its make_reader/make_writer are the one binding to ReadProcessMemory and
WriteProcessMemory. This module keeps its own debug-call bindings and adds
the instruction-cache flush a freshly written 0xCC needs.
