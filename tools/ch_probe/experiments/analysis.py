"""Pure number-crunching for the two hit-window experiments.

This file has no ctypes, no debugger, no game. It takes rows of numbers the
runners collected and turns them into answers. Because it touches nothing live,
its whole logic is unit-testable with fabricated data, and its unit test always
runs.

Three jobs live here.

1. Boundary detector. The active probe fires inputs near one edge of the hit
   window and records, per input, "the engine measured this delta, and it
   counted as HIT / MISS". Small deltas hit, big deltas miss. The edge is the
   value where hit turns into miss. `find_window_edge` finds it.

2. Clamp verdict. The passive probe reads two numbers per note: the raw value
   the window formula returns, and the value the engine actually stores and
   uses. If the stored value climbs right along with the raw one, there is no
   clamp. If the stored value flat-lines near 85 ms while the raw one keeps
   rising, the clamp is real. `clamp_verdict` decides which.

3. Parabola predictor. `predicted_window_normal` reproduces the game's
   normal-mode formula so a plot can draw predicted-versus-measured on the same
   axes.

Everything here is stdlib only, so the test never needs a game or a debugger.
