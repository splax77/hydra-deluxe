"""Game-side reception test: which drum keys does Clone Hero actually see?

The Notepad test proved SendInput delivers all eight keys to the OS. But in a
real run only A, S, L score; J, K, U, Y, T never do. So the question now is
narrow: does the GAME'S input layer receive J/K/U/Y/T at all?

This fires each drum key one at a time, slowly, with a long visible hold, into
the focused Clone Hero window. On the gameplay highway, pressing a lane's key
lights that lane's pad (or flashes the kick bar) even when no note is there --
so you can watch which keys the game registers, independent of note timing.

How to run it:
  1. Start the song in Clone Hero so the highway is up and responsive.
     (During the count-in or early play is fine -- ignore the falling notes;
     just watch the PADS at the bottom.)
  2. Run this script. It prints each key as it fires; watch the pad row.
  3. Tell me which pads lit: e.g. "green and red flashed, kick flashed,
     nothing for J/K/U/Y/T".

If A/S/L light their pads but J/K/U/Y/T light nothing -> the game's input
layer is dropping those five keys, and that's the real bug to chase.
If every pad lights -> the game receives all keys, and the miss is about
timing/targeting in play_chart, not reception.
