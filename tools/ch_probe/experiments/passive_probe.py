"""Experiment 1: the passive probe. LIVE-ONLY orchestration.

What it does, in one line: watch a real song play, and for every note read the
raw window the formula computed next to the window the engine actually stored,
so we can see whether the stored value is clamped.

How it runs:

1. Wait for a song to be playing and find the live engine by memory scan
   (engine_finder, the route play_chart.py proved at the game).
2. Attach the debugger. Debugger.attach turns kill-on-exit off, so a crash
   here detaches instead of killing Clone Hero.
3. Breakpoint the formula's first instruction. There the return address sits
   at [rsp], so plant a second breakpoint on it (once per call site). When the
   formula returns, its result is in xmm0: that is the raw window.
4. At the formula's next call the caller has stored the previous result, so
   read +0x20 then: that is the stored window for the previous note.
5. Consecutive calls' song clocks give the spacing.
6. After the chosen time, detach (always, even on Ctrl+C), write the rows and
   print the clamp verdict.

The game keeps times in seconds; rows are in milliseconds. +0x20 holds the
whole window, but whether the formula returns one side or the whole is not
known until this runs. So the first rows are printed and the verdict is given
against the measured whole window (constants.WINDOW_CAP_MS) and its half.
