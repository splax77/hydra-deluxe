"""The contract between the seven pieces of the probe tool.

Read this before writing any module. Each piece implements the Protocol named
for it here. Keeping the signatures fixed is what lets the pieces be built
independently and still snap together: the engine model calls the process and
debugger through these methods, and the experiment runners call everything
through them, without anyone having seen anyone else's implementation.

These are structural Protocols (duck typing). A module does NOT have to inherit
from them -- it just has to expose methods with these names and shapes. The
concrete class names in parentheses are the expected ones; match them so the
experiment runners can import them by name.

Nothing here does real work. This file is documentation with teeth: a module
that drifts from its Protocol will fail the type/attribute checks the
integration step runs.
