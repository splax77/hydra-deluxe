"""Write tiny Clone Hero .chart files made of isolated note pairs.

The active probe needs clean geometry to test. Real songs bury the spacing we
want inside a wall of other notes. So instead we generate our own chart: for
each spacing we care about, drop exactly two drum notes that far apart in time,
with a long silence around them so nothing else can interfere.

The output is the classic Moonscraper text .chart format -- the same one the
existing notes.chart files in this repo use. It has a [Song] header, a
[SyncTrack] that sets the tempo, an empty [Events] block, and an [ExpertDrums]
section holding the notes. chart_text writes every probe chart, including
probe_songs' named songs.

Everything here is pure text generation. No game and no debugger is involved,
so the whole module is unit-testable: generate a chart, parse it back, and
check the tick spacing came out right.
