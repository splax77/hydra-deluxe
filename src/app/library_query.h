// matching (case, accents, full-width letters, whitespace), how Clone Hero's
// rich-text tags are removed, how a typed query is read, whether a row
// matches it, and which bytes of a shown string to highlight. Pure functions
// with no ImGui and no store, so the library table and the song panel share
// them and the unit tests pin them.
