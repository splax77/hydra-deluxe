// A small thread pool shared by the library scan (hashing chart files) and

// Picture a kitchen pass. Cooks (worker threads) each take the next ticket,
// cook it, and set the plate on the pass. One runner (the calling thread)
// carries plates out in the order they land. When the kitchen closes early,
// the last cook to leave rings the bell, so the runner never stands at an
// empty pass waiting for a plate nobody is cooking.

// Runs work(i) for every i in [0, count) on up to `worker_count` threads, and
// hands each result to consume(Result&&) on the calling thread in the order
// the results finish. consume never runs on a worker, so it may write the
// store or touch UI state.
//
// Once *cancel is set, workers stop taking new items. Items already running
// finish (work decides how fast) and still reach consume, so consume sees
// every item that was started and nothing else. The call returns once every
// worker has left. The last one out wakes the consumer while holding the
// lock, so the wake-up cannot slip in between the consumer's check and its
// wait.
//
// If consume throws, workers stop taking items, the pool is joined, and the
// exception propagates. work must not throw: catch inside it. Result must be
// default-constructible and movable.
//
// worker_count must be at least 1; batch_worker_count (app/analysis.h) owns
// that floor. A smaller count throws std::invalid_argument naming it, since
// with no cooks nothing would ever reach the pass.
