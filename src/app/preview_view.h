// Preview view-model — the note highway as plain data, built here so the
// derivation is testable without a Direct3D frame or an audio device.
//
// The Preview tab renders a chart's notes — at the difficulty and drum mode
// the library's View row selects — as a scrolling 3D highway (see
// docs/adr/0005). This module turns a parsed Song (and, when the
// chart has been analyzed, the selected Path) into a PreviewScene: notes with
// their lane and drum attributes at resolved ms/measure positions, plus the
// spans the highway shades — SP phrases, solos, and activation fills — and the
// path overlay's activation moments. The renderer and the transport UI consume
// this; they compute no timing of their own.
//
// Everything here derives from one SongTiming (the song's own), so every ms in
// a scene shares the engine's timing truth and cannot drift between notes and
// overlay. Follows the path_view.h pattern: resolve the facts once, render dumb.
