// Every version stamp on stored, computed data, in one file (ADR 0018).

// A saved row was computed by some build of Hydra. Before this build shows
// it, it asks one question: would this build have computed the same thing?
// Each kind of stored data answers with a stamp saved on the row. A StampRule
// holds the stamp this build writes and every stamp it reads as current, and
// StampRule::is_current is the only place a stored stamp is compared. The
// store's SQL twin of the results check (record_store.cpp) is built from the
// same lists.
//
// None of these is the app version. A release that changes nothing a stamp
// covers keeps every saved row.

// change, whenever analysis output changes in a way the path format and the
// hydra_rules.ini fingerprint don't already catch: the engine (src/search),
// the scoring (src/core), or what a record holds. Then shrink `accepted` to
// the new stamp alone. A stale result reads Stale and asks for re-analysis.
//
// "2.1.0": the engine now stores each activation's SP-end history and
// re-anchors the transfer scales on it (ADR 0021), and each tied variant
// keeps its own facts (ADR 0022). Every release from 1.8.4 to 2.0.0 stamped
// "1.8.2", and those results hold different values, so they read Stale.

// The stored path layout: the structure blob and the node payloads it points
// at share this one number, because a node is only ever read through its
// structure. BUMP IT when either layout changes. Its history:
// 3 added clamp_tick to nodes. 4 put the u64 rules fingerprint right after
// the version and added sqout_tick and collected_phrase_ticks (ADR 0014).
// 5 spelled every chord as its lane code (ADR 0015). 6 moved the multiplier
// squeezes and root totals into the structure and left a node holding its
// activations alone (ADR 0017). 7 stored the SP-end history and the bank and
// fill lists, stored the squeeze-out once, and gave each SqIn its own
// transfer scale (ADR 0021). It also dropped each row's is_sp flag, let a
// transfer scale be stored as unknown, and gave each tied variant its own
// trailing bank in its tree entry (ADR 0022).

// ---- Dynamics counts (the dynamics table) ----------------------------------

// How notes are counted. BUMP IT (add 1) whenever count_dynamics, or the
// parser that feeds it, changes what any chart counts: src/parse/song.cpp
// (the .mid, .chart and .sng loaders), src/parse/midi.cpp and
// src/parse/srb.cpp. The hydra_rules.ini fingerprint doesn't apply: the rules
// move activation marks, never which notes a chart has. A stale count reads as
// missing, and the Dynamics tab recounts it in the background.
// 0 = rows saved before the stamp existed. 1 = the first stamp.
