// SQLite-backed storage for analysis records, in the binary blob format of
// store/serialize.h. Old
// Python-era .db files are not read; a fresh scan populates a new one.
//
// Three tables carry an analysis (schema user_version 3):
//
//   * `results` — one row per run, keyed by the FULL settings it ran under:
//     the chart, the chart mode, the SP cap, the Lens (ms limit, score
//     range and fill rule) and the hydra_rules.ini fingerprint (schema 4), so
//     a result made under other rules is kept beside this build's. Summary
//     columns are denormalized onto it so a sortable library
//     listing never has to inflate anything. The row holds a *structure* blob
//     (the path tree's shape) rather than the paths themselves.
//   * `paths` — every distinct path node, content-addressed by its hash and
//     shared across every result that references it (store/path_codec.h). A
//     path is never stored twice.
//   * `path_refs` — which nodes each result uses, so the store can garbage
//     collect a node the moment nothing points at it.
//
// `songmeta` (one row per chart file, keyed by content hash) is unchanged.
//
// Why the full settings and not just the cap: a run under a different ms
// limit or score range is a different answer, and overwriting one with the
// other lost the first. Now they coexist, and a lookup asks for the one it
// wants. The SP cap half of that identity is docs/adr/0003; lookups name the
// cap with a CapQuery and the rest with a Lens.
