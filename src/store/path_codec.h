// Content-addressed path storage — how the store keeps a record.
//
// A record is not written as one nested blob with every path and variant
// inlined in tree order. This codec splits it in two.
//
//   * Each Path *node* becomes a flat, context-free payload: its own fields
//     and nothing about where it sits in the tree. Two nodes with the same
//     fields produce the same bytes, so they share one stored copy.
//   * A record's *structure* blob records the tree shape only — which node
//     hash is each root, which hashes hang off it as variants, and at which
//     var_point.
//
// A node payload is named by a 128-bit content hash of its bytes, so the same
// path stored twice (in two records, or twice in one) is written once. Nothing
// in a payload depends on the record it came from.
//
// Flat storage is safe because tree-contextual data is rebuilt on load, not
// read from a node. A node holds a path's own activations and nothing else.
// A root's totals (six score categories, note count, leftover SP) sit next to
// it in the structure blob, and Path::prepare_variants() copies the score
// totals and note count onto each variant and rebuilds variant_tail from
// var_point. A variant's leftover SP (its trailing bank) is its own, so it is
// stored with the variant's tree entry, next to its var_point. The chart's
// multiplier squeezes are stored once, in the structure (docs/adr/0017).
//
// A deserialized record carries raw-tick Timecodes only — call
// restore_timecodes() with the song's SongTiming.
//
// CONSTRAINT: var_point is stored per *variant*, on the edge from a parent to
// a child, never on a root. Engine::emit_path only assigns var_point when
// depth != 0, so an engine-produced root always carries nullopt and nothing is
// lost. A hand-built record whose root path has a var_point would lose it here.
