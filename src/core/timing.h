// Timing math: converting between ticks, milliseconds and measures.
//
// A song measures time in ticks; the app also needs milliseconds (from the
// tempo map) and measure/beat/tick and decimal-measure positions (from the
// meter map). Timecode carries all of these for one tick. MsIndex and
// MeasureIndex are the binary-search accelerators the Python side caches on its
// TempoMaps; here they are built once per song into SongTiming and reused.
//
// The arithmetic keeps a fixed operation order and integer floor semantics:
// stored records and pathstrings depend on these ms/measure values
// bit-for-bit, so any change here silently invalidates stored results.
