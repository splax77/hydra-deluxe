// Squeeze rating — where an activation's Star Power ends, how frontend
// timing error carries to that end, and how the resulting squeezes are
// judged for display.
//
// One home for all of it: the transfer scales, which scale directions
// matter, which multiplier governs a note, and what its margin is worth on
// the nominal two-hit scale. The search never reads
// the judgement side; difficulty and the ms filter stay raw gap ms (see
// core/model.h).
//
// The deactivation node itself is not worked out here. The search stamps it
// onto every activation it produces, and everything below reads that field.
//
// Three functions are the module's entries:
//   rate_activation()          -- the details display's only interface.
//   activation_deact_tick()    -- the Preview's, for the active SP window.
//   frontend_transfer_scales() -- the engine's copy-out stamp, so a record's
//                                 stored ratios and a live recompute agree.
// Everything else below is an internal piece, declared only so its own tests
// can reach it directly. No production caller should use them.

// offsets are measured against, mid-SP phrase extensions included); `pre`
// is measured one 2-measure step before D and governs the SqIn feasibility
// (the phrase note must land inside SP as it stands *before* the phrase is
// collected). Without a SqIn the two are identical. With several SqIns, or
// a plain collection after the last one, `pre` is exact only for the last
// extension — one pair per activation is all this carries.
