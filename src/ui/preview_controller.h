// PreviewController — owns the live 3D Preview for one open chart.
//
// The details modal's Preview tab drives this. It ties together an async
// PreviewLoadJob (re-parse + decode + build scene), the offscreen
// PreviewRenderer (the Onyx port, docs/adr/0008), a PreviewTransport over the
// mixed audio, and a PreviewAudioDevice that plays it. The Transport owns the
// play/pause/seek rules and the master display clock, as in Onyx: the highway
// is drawn at transport_.tick() each frame, and on play the audio is seeked to
// that time and then follows. A chart with no audio still plays and scrubs.
//
// One controller lives on AppState, created on first use with the GUI's shared
// D3D11 device. It is opened for the selected chart, torn down when the modal
// or selection changes, and only renders + decodes while the Preview tab shows
// — so a library browse never spins up a GPU scene or an audio device.
