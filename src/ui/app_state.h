// Shared UI state — the C++ port of hydra_app.py's HyAppUserSettings /
// HyAppRecordBook / HyAppState. One AppState is built at startup and handed
// to every view's render function each frame.
//
// Persistence differs from Python on purpose: settings live in their own INI
// next to the executable (not hymisc.INIPATH's format) and the chart library
// table now lives on RecordStore (see store/record_store.h) instead of a
// separate ad hoc scan_library() connection — both were free to redesign,
// same as the record format itself (Phase 4).
