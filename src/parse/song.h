// Chart parsing — the C++ port of hydra/hysong.py.
//
// Turns a .mid/.chart/.sng/.srb file into a Song: a tick-ordered sequence of
// SongTimestamps (a Timecode + Chord + solo/SP/fill flags), plus the tempo and
// meter maps. The MidiParser and ChartParser live in the .cpp; callers use the
// load_songpath_* functions.
//
// Every load_* function takes the difficulty to read and defaults to Expert.
