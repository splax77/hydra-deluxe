// The output-device half of the Preview player.
//
// The audio playhead (audio/player.h) is pure and device-free; this wraps a
// miniaudio playback device around a pull callback that supplies frames on
// miniaudio's audio thread. The device knows nothing about what it pulls from
// and holds no lock of its own: the lock lives in the Transport that supplies
// the source (src/ui/preview_transport.h), which takes it inside the callback.
// The device is torn down (stopped, so the callback has returned) before the
// source it calls may be destroyed, so destroy the device first.
//
// miniaudio's device API lives only here, kept private to hydra_audio like the
// decoders; the header stays free of miniaudio via a pImpl.
