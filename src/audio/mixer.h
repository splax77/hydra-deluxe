// Stem mixer for the Preview engine.
//
// A chart often ships several stems (song, drums, guitar, ...) and no combined
// file, so the Preview must sum them into one signal to play. Stems decode at
// their own sample rates and channel counts (see audio/decode.h), so the mixer
// converts each to a common output format and adds it into the mix, one stem
// at a time: only one decoded stem and its converted copy are alive beside the
// mix, never all of them.
// The mixed length is the longest stem's; shorter stems contribute silence past
// their end. Summing can push peaks past [-1, 1]; clamping is the player's job,
// not the mixer's, so the raw sum is preserved here for testability.
//
// StreamMix (audio/stream_mix.h) does the same mix while playing, straight from
// the compressed stems, with no decoded buffer. mix_stems stays as its test
// reference: a StreamMix read start to end must equal it. decode_and_mix and
// pad_front_ms go once the load job opens a StreamMix instead.
