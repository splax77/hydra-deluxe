// Where the highway lands on the Preview image, and the scale that keeps the
// Preview's text boxes (the time and score boxes top-left, the SP drain box
// top-right) beside it rather than on it. Device-free: the same camera and
// track height the renderer draws with, projected on the CPU.
//
// The highway's size follows the track height, not the image width, so a
// narrower window leaves less room at its sides. The boxes shrink into that
// room, never past kOverlayMinScale (below it the text stops being readable,
// so they overlap instead) and never above 1 (their configured size).
//
// The next-activation box stands on the image's bottom edge, where the
// highway is widest, so its room is measured there; it wraps its lines to
// that room (wrap_words) rather than shrink every box to fit its longest line.
//
// Also the "…" cut for a label too long for its space (ellipsize), measured
// by the caller's font so it stays device-free.
