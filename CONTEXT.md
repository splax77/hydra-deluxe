# Hydra

Score optimizer and path viewer for Clone Hero drums: it scans a song library,
analyzes each chart, and shows the Star Power paths that give the best score.

## Language

### Library

**Chart**:
One playable song file (`.mid`, `.chart`, `.sng`, or `.srb`) plus its metadata.
_Avoid_: song file, track

**Library**:
The set of charts found by the latest scan of the user's folders.

**Scan**:
The pass that discovers charts in the configured folders and registers them in
the library. Distinct from analysis.

**Analyze**:
The search that computes a chart's paths and stores the result as a record.

**Record**:
The stored result of one analysis: the kept paths, their scores, and the
settings the analysis ran with. Its key is the chart and its analysis
settings: the chart mode, the SP cap, the fill rule, the path limit and the
score range. A chart
keeps one record per settings combination; records share their stored paths,
so a path found under several combinations is stored once. A record is stale
unless both hold: it carries a results stamp this build accepts (a stamp that
changes only when analysis output changes, not with every release; see
src/store/stored_versions.h), and its stored paths are in
this build's path-structure format under the rules in force. A lookup reports
it as one of three statuses: not
analyzed, stale, or ready. A listing returns only ready records, so a stale
record reads the same as no record at all.

**SP cap**:
The Star Power meter ceiling an analysis runs under, in bars. 4 is Clone
Hero's rule and the default. Other values answer what-if questions; their
scores are not achievable in game.
_Avoid_: edition, uncapped, SP meter

**Analysis settings**:
The seven settings that make up a record's identity, shown together in the
settings bar and applied to every song: difficulty, Pro Drums and 2x Bass
(together the chart mode), the SP cap, 1.0 fills (the fill spawn deadline),
the score range, and the path limit.
Changing one shows the records made under the new combination; changing it
back brings the old ones back without analyzing again. The backend limit is
not one of them: it only hides backend rows on screen and never re-analyzes.
_Avoid_: view options

**Library search**:
What the user types to narrow the library. Every word must match the title,
artist, charter or folder, in any order; `"quotes"` match a phrase, and
`title:`, `artist:`, `charter:` and `folder:` limit a word or phrase to one
field. `stars:N` (exactly N stars) and `squeeze<=N` (hardest squeeze at most N
ms) test the stored best path and only ever match ready records. Matching
folds case and accents away, so `beyonce` finds "Beyoncé", and ignores Clone
Hero's rich-text tags.

### Paths

**Path**:
One way to play a chart's Star Power: which activations to take and what each
is worth. The first path in a record is optimal.

**Activation**:
One use of banked Star Power, written in path notation with its skip count and
squeeze symbols (e.g. `E2+-`).

**Skip**:
A fill an activation deliberately passes over before activating.

**SP phrase**:
A chart section that awards a bar of Star Power when hit fully.
_Avoid_: star power section

**All-0 path**:
The best path whose activations all record zero skips, found under a 0 ms
timing limit.

### Squeezes

**Squeeze**:
A deliberately early or late hit that moves points across a scoring boundary.

**Frontend squeeze**:
Hitting the activation chord's activation note first, so the chord's other
notes score under Star Power.

**Backend squeeze**:
Hitting a note near the SP end early, so it lands inside Star Power.

**SqIn / SqOut**:
Squeezing an SP phrase's note into (+) or out of (-) an active Star Power
window, written as the `+`/`-` symbols in path notation. Only a phrase after
the activation chord can be squeezed: one at or before it was banked before
SP started (core/sqout_chord.h, `activation_can_squeeze`).

**Multiplier squeeze**:
Ordering the hits of a multi-note chord on a combo-multiplier boundary so the
more valuable notes score on the higher multiplier.

**Star cutoff**:
The score a chart needs for 1 to 7 stars: its base score (every note at 1x,
no Star Power) times 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.8, 3.6 or 4.4, rounded up. Clone
Hero compares it against your score without the solo bonus.

**Early fill (E)**:
An activation timing (the `E` notation) where the fill must be summoned by
hitting early; its window is fixed, not the hit-window setting.

**Fill spawn deadline (CH 1.1)**:
The latest your SP meter can fill up and still have a fill appear. Clone Hero
1.1 puts it a flat 4 beats before the fill starts. Hydra's default rule.

**Fill spawn deadline (CH 1.0)**:
The older rule: roughly one fill-length of lead time before the fill, clamped
to 250..10000 ms. Short fills got stricter in 1.1 and long fills got looser.
The "1.0 fills" analysis setting, or `hydra_batch --legacy-fills` into its own
database. Part of a record's key, so 1.0 and 1.1 records sit side by side;
`hydra_fillcompare` diffs the two. See docs/adr/0010.

**Hit window**:
The per-side ms window Clone Hero registers a hit in. A setting; feeds the
squeeze budgets, ratings, and report tiers, never the search.

**Transfer scale**:
How frontend timing error carries to the SP end. SP length is measured in
measures, so a hit `d` ms off moves the SP end `r*d` ms; early and late hits
can scale differently on a signature or tempo change. It is measured from the
note whose timing moves the SP end: the activation, or the cap's collecting
note. Each SqIn stores its own scale, at the SP end it was measured from
(docs/adr/0021).

**SP-end history**:
Every place an activation's SP end moved, in order: the activation, each
phrase collected, each cap clamp and each SqIn, with the end in force after
it. The engine stores it once per activation. The deact node, the clamp note
and the collected phrases are read from it (docs/adr/0021).

**Deact node**:
The exact chart position where an activation's Star Power ends; backend
squeeze timings are measured against it. The search stamps it onto the
record as it runs, and nothing downstream re-derives it.
_Avoid_: SP end tick (when the anchored search position is meant)

**Cap-clamped window**:
Normally an activation's Star Power window ends a fixed distance (measures)
past the activation. But if a phrase collected partway through Star Power
fills the meter all the way to the SP cap (the max bars of SP you can hold),
the window's end gets pinned to that phrase's note instead — the meter can't
go any higher, so collecting more SP can't push the end out any further.
`clamp_tick` stores which note pinned it, so later code doesn't have to guess.

**Squeeze rating**:
The displayed difficulty judgement of a squeeze: its rating label, its
effective ms once the transfer scale is applied, and whether the scale is
material enough to warn about.

**Difficulty**:
A path's or activation's hardest required squeeze, in raw gap ms — never
scaled by the transfer scale.

### Preview

**Preview**:
The rendered, playable view of a chart: its notes as a scrolling 3D highway,
synced to the song audio. Distinct from a Path (the scoring plan) and a Chart
(the song file).
_Avoid_: player, viewer

**Note highway**:
The 3D fretboard the Preview draws, with the drum notes scrolling toward the
strike line as the song plays.
_Avoid_: fretboard, track

**Gem**:
One drawn note on the note highway. Its model shows the drum type (tom, cymbal,
or kick), its texture shows the lane, the note's dynamics, and whether it sits
in an SP phrase. Dynamics are a velocity rule that applies to every lane, kick
included: velocity 1 is a ghost, velocity 127 an accent, and both score double
(see docs/adr/0012).
_Avoid_: note (the chart datum), block

**Lane**:
One column of the note highway, in KRYBG order. The four playable lanes
(Red..Green) spread across the highway; Kick is the full-width bar.

**Strike line**:
The fixed line on the note highway where a note is due to be hit. Notes scroll
down to it as the song plays; a gem flashes there when it passes.
_Avoid_: hit line, target line, target (the Onyx name)

**Beat line**:
A line across the note highway at a bar, a beat, or the half-beat before one,
drawn from the chart's timing.

**Active SP window**:
The stretch of the note highway from an activation to its deact node, where
Star Power is being spent. Comes from the path, not the chart; drawn as a
tinted floor.

**Path overlay**:
Hydra's own analysis drawn on the note highway: the active SP windows and the
fills as a player following the path would see them. A fill the path
activates on is *taken* (all four lanes lit, the activation note's lane
highlighted); a fill the path had enough SP for but passed over is *offered*
(lanes lit dimly); every other candidate fill is hidden, because the game would
not have shown it. Offered fills are the ones the engine stored on each
activation as passed over; nothing guesses them from a count. For a tied
variant, the activations after the fold carry its leader's passed-over fills
until finding 97 is fixed, and a fill the path took always stays taken. Fills
after the last activation are hidden because the engine records nothing about
them.

**SP meter gauge**:
The vertical gauge on the note highway's right edge showing banked Star Power
at the playhead. With a path, every value is the record's. Between activations
it steps up one bar at each tick where the engine stamped a bar's arrival. In
an active window it shows the measures left until the SP end in force, two
measures to a bar, and the record lists every place that end moved. It empties
exactly at the deact node. The gauge counts no phrases and applies no cap. A
late squeeze-in refills at the old SP end, because the player hits that phrase
early and SP never stops. A squeezed-out phrase's bar arrives when the player
hits it: as SP ends for an early phrase, on its own note for a late one.
Without a path it fills one bar per phrase and pins at the cap, since nothing
spends it and there is no record to read.

**Stem**:
One of the several audio files a chart may ship instead of a single mix (e.g.
`drums`, `guitar`, `song`). The Preview mixes all of a chart's stems into one
output, unpacking each from its compressed file as it plays (docs/adr/0019).

**Mixer**:
The step that reads a chart's stems at one shared position, resamples them to
one common format, and sums them into a single signal to play. It reads a few
milliseconds at a time from each stem's compressed bytes; nothing is unpacked
up front. A stem it cannot open is skipped, so one broken stem does not
silence the rest. A stem that hits a decode error part way through goes
silent from that point.

**Transport**:
The Preview's play, pause, and seek control together with its clock. The clock
is the master: while playing it is the time at play plus the time since; the
note highway reads it to place the notes, and the audio follows it.
_Avoid_: player (the whole Preview), scrubber (the UI control only), playhead
(the audio follower only)
